    <h2>What Is Tailwind CSS?</h2>
    <p>
        Tailwind CSS was originally developed by Adam Wathan and was first released on November 1st, 2017.
        It is a utility-first low-level framework in order to apply CSS. It means you won't need to write a lot of CSS. 
        Instead, you will write numerous classes for your HTML elements. <br>
        Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for building responsive, mobile-first projects on the web. 
        Tailwind CSS, on the other hand, is the most popular utility-first CSS framework for fast UI development. <br>
        The main difference between TailwindCSS and Bootstrap is that Tailwind CSS is not a UI kit. Unlike UI kits such as
        Bootstrap, Bulma, and Foundation, Tailwind CSS doesnâ€™t have a default theme or built-in UI components. Instead, it comes
        with predesigned widgets you can use to build your site from scratch.
