        <p>Atticus said to Jem one day, “I’d rather you shot at tin cans in
            the backyard, but I know you’ll go after birds. Shoot all the 
            blue jays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin 
            to kill a mockingbird.” That was the only time I ever heard 
            Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie
            about it. “Your father’s right,” she said. “Mockingbirds don’t do 
            one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don’t eat up 
            people’s gardens, don’t nest in corn cribs, they don’t do one thing
             but sing their hearts out for us. That’s why it’s a sin to kill a 
             mockingbird.
